We are offering a monthly virtual event where CUDA enthusiasts can connect directly with a panel of real-life CUDA developers at NVIDIA. This is a chance to meet some of the people designing and implementing your favorite CUDA drivers, kernels, libraries and tools; and ask questions related to your project or work.

We've moved all event information to our NVIDIA On-demand Webinar Platform.  Please visit us [here](https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/experience/elitenvidiabrill/1640195/4823520/nvidia-webinar-connect-with-experts).
